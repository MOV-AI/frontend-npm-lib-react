## Troubleshooting

## Invalid hook

When running the lib-react locally from IDE, you might have an issue with invalid hooks with the following message: "Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component"

To fix it, stop the development server of IDE, stop the buildDev of lib-react and run the following command in lib-react repository root:

`sudo npm link ../frontend-npm-ide/node_modules/react`
